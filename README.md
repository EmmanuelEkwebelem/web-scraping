# HHA 507 - Assignment # 7

This repository represents the completion of HHA 504 Assignment # 7

Instructions:

Create a new github repo called 'web-scraping' 

Using BS4, find at least 2 websites that you want to scrap data from - provide that code within a .py file  

In the code, for each website - create at least one dataframe that has structured data 

Save each of the dataframes as separate .csv files into a "/data" folder within your repo - be sure to include the .csv files within your repo (make sure they are small, < 25mb) 

Include a markdown file in the repo which includes instructions (e.g., what are the required python packages to run this, your approach for scrapping the data - the div/classes/css tags you found to extract the information)
